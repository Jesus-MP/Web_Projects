		Week1: Hike Hansen Dam
		</h2>
		
		<p style="width:80%">
		
		Today was a good day to go out and go hiking. This is one of my favorite parks
		because it's so close to my house. All I need to do is wake up and go hiking. It has 
		some pretty cool trails. I went in the morning before the sun got too bad because I didn't 
		buy any sunscreen. Overall, it went well I was done by around noon.

		Week2: Hike El Escorpion Park
		</h2>
		<p style="width:80%">
		
		This is a trail that one of my friends recommended. I woke up early because I didn't know where
		it was exactly. However, soon enough I was able to find the place. The scenery was amazing. It was really
		nice. There were some really cool hills and rocks. I even saw a scorpion hence the name of the park. Overall, it was a really
		great experience.
